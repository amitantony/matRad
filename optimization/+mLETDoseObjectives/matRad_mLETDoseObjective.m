classdef (Abstract) matRad_mLETDoseObjective < matRad_DoseOptimizationFunction
% matRad_mLETDoseObjective: Interface for optimization objectives
%   This abstract base class provides the structure of optimization
%   objectives like mean mLETDose, squared deviation, EUmLETDose, mLETDose-volume etc.
%   Implementations can be found in the mLETDoseObjectives package
